### Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Oscar.
Here you will find some of my newest projects that I'm working on.

## Not only a programmer
- I'm currently working as a [soldier] in the [spanish army]. I know it has nothing to do with IT but surely this is giving me a life experience that I can focus into increasing my programming productivity, my working habits and many other facts of my IT career.
- I started has a web developer but I like multiplatform projects too since I know Python and Java as well.
- My favourite language is Javascript!
- I love security so breaking the code is also a number one rule when building an application. Implementing all kind of security measures is really important in long term projects.
